ðŸŒ± I am a Junior Software Developer, proficient in C# using ASP.NET Core and JavaScript using Node.js.
- âš¡ Notable milestones through my journey in programming so far:
- ðŸ”­ I did a 3-months-long JavaScript themed bootcamp with Northcoders, which I finished in June.
- ðŸ”­ Then I decided to learn the C# language and related frameworks. Initially I did the courses on freecodecamp, then later I went on and subscribed to an online learning website, where I learned the fundamentals of  ASP.NET Core.
